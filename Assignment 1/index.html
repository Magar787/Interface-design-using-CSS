        <h1>PERFECT</h1>
        <p>I found a love for me<br>
            Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead<br>
            Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet<br>
            Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me<br>
            'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love<br>
            Not knowing what it was<br>
            I will not give you up this time<br>
            But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own<br>
            And in your eyes, you're holding mine</p>

        <p class="HOOK1">Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms<br>
            Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song<br>
            When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath<br>
            But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight</p>

        <p>Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know<br>
            She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home<br>
            I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets<br>
            To carry love, to carry children of our own<br>
            We are still kids, but we're so in love<br>
            Fighting against all odds<br>
            I know we'll be alright this time<br>
            Darling, just hold my hand<br>
            Be my girl, I'll be your man<br>
            I see my future in your eyes</p>

        <p class="HOOK2">Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms<br>
            Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song<br>
            When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful<br>
            I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight</p>
